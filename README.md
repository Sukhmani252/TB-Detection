# TB-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning

- Employed pre-trained Inception net V3 as a base model, fine-tuned with CNN layers for Chest X-ray image-based TB detection.
- Achieved 97% accuracy by transfer learning from general layers to TB-specific layers and utilizing an SVM classifier for classification.
